# Germany Axial Flow Compressors Market global revenue Cost Pattern, Supply, Production forecasted (2025-2033)

<strong>Axial Flow Compressors Market Snapshot 2025-2033 provides a concise overview of market trends, forecasts, and growth opportunities over the forecast period:</strong>

An axial flow compressor is a compressor that can continuously pressurize gases. It is a rotating, airfoil-based compressor in which the gas or working fluid principally flows parallel to the axis of rotation, or axially. This differs from other rotating compressors such as centrifugal compressors, axi-centrifugal compressors and mixed-flow compressors where the fluid flow will include a &#34;radial component&#34; through the compressor. The energy level of the fluid increases as it flows through the compressor due to the action of the rotor blades which exert a torque on the fluid. The stationary blades slow the fluid, converting the circumferential component of flow into pressure. Compressors are typically driven by an electric motor or a steam or a gas turbine.
